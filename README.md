# AI: Principles & Techniques Assignment 1 : Four In A Row 

This is a given assignment in the course AI: Principles & Techniques at Radboud University.  In this assignment, I have implemented MinMax algorithm with pruning and without pruning. I have used Alpha-Beta pruning to decrease the complexity of the algorithm.
I have made comparison between the algorithms with and without pruning about their design choices and implementations. Also I have tested them and discussed the results based on their complexity. The report itself can be found in the file Report
